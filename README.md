  Occupation: 1 NFT for 1 job:
  
    Farmer! Grow and feed

    Host! An NFT deposit will be given to the tenant
    Chef! Craft food that restores HP and MP
    Guild Master! Send and receive quests from other players
     â€¦ Can do many jobs, can assign a career to Support.

  P2P communication: 1 item
